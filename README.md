# Roman Reign

Roman Reign is a 2D side-scrolling wave defense platformer which was developed by a small group of students over the course of twelve weeks for a college assignment.

The game is set during the Roman conquest of Britain. The player character is a Scottish warrior who takes up arms against the Roman soldiers and makes his last stand at [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall).
